			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			My name is <div class="name">Kelvin Lien</div>.  I'm currently a senior in college, with plans to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences after this upcoming spring semester.
			This is a site meant to contain the rambling thoughts I have in my head, as well as tell a little bit about myself.
