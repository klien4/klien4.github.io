			<h3>Something smells nice...</h3>
			<p>
				This page is for listing foods that I like to eat.  A lot of foods.  I don't really have any singular favorite food, since they're all really good.  There are no pictures here since I think it's kind of weird to take pictures of food your family just cooked for you (also because I'm bad at taking good pictures of food).  Instead, each food name will link to a corresponding Wikipedia page if it exists.  You'll also probably notice that most of these are from Vietnam.  I'm sure you can venture a guess as to why.
			</p>
			<h4>The main foods:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho">Pho</a>: A Vietnamese staple.  The star anise does wonders for both flavor and fragrance.  In Vietnam, this is often eaten as breakfast, though doing that here in the US would probably get you some weird looks.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh">Bánh</a>: Literally, this means bread.  However, bánh is a blanket term for all sorts of bread-related foodstuffs.  Placing this in main foods is a disservice to maybe a third of the other bánh that are eaten as snacks or desserts. For the sake of brevity, I'll only mention three:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC">Bánh mì</a>: Another Vietnamese classic.  Extremely versatile in what you can put on it.  A personal favorite combination of mine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3_l%E1%BB%A5a">chả lụa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_siu">xá xíu</a>, cucumber, cilantro, pickled carrots, pickled daikon, dehydrated fried onions, and a spread of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9">pâté</a> on the top and bottom.  Also good to eat any time of day in Vietnam.</li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_bao">Bánh bao</a>: a bun with pork, onion, mushroom, egg, and occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sausage">lạp xưởng</a> (aka Chinese sausage).  Humble, but delicious nonetheless.  Good for breakfast or as a snack in between meals.</li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_x%C3%A8o">Bánh xèo</a>: A fried rice pancake filled with pork, shrimp, diced green onion, and bean sprouts, along with other things depending on the ingredients at hand.  Usually dipped into or drizzled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_ch%E1%BA%A5m">nước mắm pha</a> (fish sauce with some other stuff to make it better for general consumption), a dip with pickled carrots and daikon in it.  Calling this a 'pancake' or 'crepe' tends to give off the wrong impression of sweetness, whereas bánh xèo is more savory (as I'm sure the ingredients list told you).</li>
				</ul>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee">cháo</a>: Also known as congee, it's essentially rice porridge.  In its simplest form, rice porridge is all this is, with modifications to the broth the rice cooks in helping to add flavor.  I'll usually be having these plain versions along with ginger if I'm sick.  Usually you'll also have other food in/with it too, like chunks of pork meat, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao">quẩy</a> (aka Chinese fried breadstick), and, as is the case in my household, bits of cereal like Honey Nut Cheerios or Lucky Charms.  </li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kho_(cooking_technique)">Bò kho</a>: Basically Vietnamese beef stew.  The stew goes well with noodles, or bread that you dip in (this is appropriately called Bánh mì bò kho; I can't say I didn't have this for breakfast in Vietnam either).  The Wikipedia page is for the cooking technique 'kho' since there weren't any other options.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C6%A1m_t%E1%BA%A5m">Cơm tấm</a>: A rice dish using broken (that is, fragmented and fractured) rice grains.  While the 'broken' in the name of the rice might seem bad, it tastes the same as normal non-broken rice, so there isn't any downside.  At my house, it's usually accompanied by lettuce, tomato, cucumber, nước mắm pha, pickled carrots, pickled daikon (both of these are usually in the aforementioned nước mắm pha), scallion and oil garnish (alternatively, just call it mỡ hành), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dn_n%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng">sườn nướng</a> (aka pork ribs).  The ribs can be exchanged for or accompanied by chả trứng (aka egg meatloaf, although I feel that the English name makes a bad first impression).</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BAn_ri%C3%AAu">Bún riêu</a>: A noodle dish with a clear yet vividly red soup.  I'm not sure I can describe this dish any better than that, but that doesn't mean its bad by any stretch of the imagination.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%E1%BB%8Fi_cu%E1%BB%91n">Gỏi cuốn</a>: Spring rolls, with a versatile selection of food to place within.  At home, we have it one of two ways: one with lettuce, rice vermicelli, cucumber, shrimp, pork, and mint leaves; the other, less common one with jicama, lạp xưởng, and other things I can't remember off the top of my head.  Usually we dip these in peanut sauce (tương đậu phộng if you want to be authentic), though occasionally we use nước mắm pha instead.  Note that they don't come pre-wrapped with all the ingredients inside: we make them at the table, adding as much food into each wrap as we can reasonably fit inside.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelized_pork_and_eggs">Thịt kho</a>: Braised pork and eggs, probably some marination too.  Usually served alongside rice in my house.  The Wikipedia page mentions something about coconut juice; I don't think our version has that, but I never asked before, nor watched my parents cook it, so who knows.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>The drinks, desserts, and snacks:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Bánh: It's back.  There won't be much to say about each of these individually, but they're all good and definitely worth a try.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_c%C3%A1y">Bánh cáy</a>: Crunchy rice wafers.  For lack of a better description on Wikipedia, think of them like Vietnamese granola bars.</li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_da_l%E1%BB%A3n">Bánh da lợn</a>: Steamed layer cake (look up pictures, it'll make sense) made of rice flour, tapioca starch, and either mung bean, durian, or taro.</li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_chim_peng">Bánh tiêu</a>: Deep-fried hollow donuts with sesame seeds on top.  Hard to go wrong with donuts.</li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_r%C3%A1n">Bánh cam</a>: I'm specifying bánh cam over bánh rán since bánh cam is the one I have more experience with, not that they're all that different.  A fried glutinous rice ball filled with mung bean paste and sprinkled with sesame seeds on top.</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Sugarcane juice: What you see is what you get.  It's juice.  Made from crushing sugarcane.  Since it uses sugarcane directly, I rarely get to drink this outside of Vietnam.  It's hard to imagine a drink made from sugarcane tasting bad, though.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanh_mu%E1%BB%91i">Soda chanh muối</a>: An iced carbonated beverage made with salted pickled limes, sugar, and carbonated water (usually club soda I'm pretty sure).  Chanh muối specifically refers to the limes, so the 'soda' part at the beginning explains the rest.  It can also be made with plain water and not carbonated water, if you're into that for some reason.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_soda">soda sữa hột gà</a>: An iced carbonated beverage made with egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk, and club soda.  If you think its weird for a drink to include egg yolk, might I remind you that eggnog exists.  Also, for what it's worth, I would drink this over eggnog any day of the week, and especially around Christmas time just out of spite.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%C3%B4i">Xôi</a>: Only having xôi as this dish's name does a disservice to how many different kinds of xôi exist.  Honestly, putting this in the 'drinks and desserts' category is probably inaccurate maybe half the time.  The only thing in common between them all is their use of glutinous rice (or as my family calls it, sticky rice).  Xôi vo was by far the type I ate the most during my trips to Vietnam.  Due to its stickiness, the usual way you got it after buying it from a street vendor was in plastic wrap. From there, you could squeeze it until it became easy to carry around and take bites out of, no spoon required.</li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A8">Chè</a>: Again, only having chè as the listed name does a huge disservice to the variety of chè that exists.  Somehow, though, the name is even more of an understatement than last time.  Chè can describe drinks, puddings, desserts, and soups (and dessert soups) made from beans, jelly, fruit, and/or sticky rice.  Some of my personal favorites are chè đậu trắng, made from black-eyed peas, and chè bắp, made with corn. Chè trôi nước isn't half-bad either.</li>
