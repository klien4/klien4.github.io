		<h3>A Glimpse into the Past...</h3>
		<p>This page is for assorted picture I found on my phone from past summer vacations with my family.  These pictures are just about all the memories I have of these vacations: I got the years for these trips from my phone (photo metadata coming in handy), but a lot of the finer details, like the city names or the context behind the photos, don't exist in my head anymore.</p>
		<p>My family has more photos from a time earlier than the ones I have here, but they're physical rather than digital.  My memories of those times are even shoddier, but there are a couple of memories, such as that one time I rode an ostrich, that are still with me.</p>
